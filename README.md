ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Saayonee!

I'm a software developer with expertise in **Python** and **Java**, and I specialize in building **automation systems**, **computer vision** solutions, and **AI**-powered applications. My projects have ranged from **automating drones** with **Raspberry Pi** to creating real-time systems for **gesture recognition** and **object detection**.

Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging **machine learning** and **data science** to solve complex problems and push the boundaries of technology. Currently, I'm focused on software solutions for **embedded systems** and **robotics**.

ðŸ”­ Currently working on:
- **Autonomous systems** with real-time control and feedback.
- **Computer vision** algorithms for object detection and tracking.

ðŸŒ± Learning more about **AI/ML** integration in **embedded systems** and **automation**.
